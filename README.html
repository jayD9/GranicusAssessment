<h1 id="about-this-project">About this Project</h1>
<p>This project contains several text files, a single Java library file, and a single unit test file. The code, unit test, and data files will be the focus of this coding exercise.</p>
<h1 id="volunteers-needed">Volunteers Needed!</h1>
<p>A local food shelf needs more volunteers to help bag rice. The food shelf has multiple locations where people volunteer on the same days each week.</p>
<p>At the end of every week, each location submits a report showing how many volunteers they had and how many bags of rice were produced each day. But they're not always reaching their goals, and some people are going hungry!</p>
<p>They need to know how many more volunteers to recruit each week, so we wrote a program to calculate this for them. But it's not working correctly.</p>
Here is an example location report:<br /><br />

<table border=1 cellpadding=5 style="font-family: monospace; width:50%">
  <tr>
    <th>Volunteers</th>
    <th>Goal Bags</th>
    <th>Actual Bags</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>50</td>
    <td>30</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>15</td>
    <td>45</td>
    <td>44</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>20</td>
    <td>55</td>
    <td>40</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>22</td>
    <td>14</td>
    <td>14</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Based on this report file the extra volunteers needed per day are calculated as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bags Still Needed = Goal Bags - Actual Bags</li>
  <li>Bags Stocked Per Volunteer = Actual Bags / Volunteers</li>
  <li>Volunteers Needed = Bags Still Needed / Bags Stocked Per Volunteer</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="input">Input</h2>
<p>There are two <code>food_shelf_*.txt</code> files in this project. The contents are described as follows:
  <ul>
    <li>The first line of the input is a single line containing comma-separated headers (volunteers, goal bags, actual bags)</li>
    <li>The next <strong>N</strong> lines each contain comma-separated data for a day of the week.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h2 id="output">Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, the script should output <strong>N-1</strong> lines. Each line should contain the volunteers needed for each day of the week in the food shelf input file, one per line.</p>
<h2 id="running-the-program">Running the Program</h2>
<pre><code>ant run -Dfile=src/resources/food_shelf_north.txt</code></pre>
<h2 id="running-the-tests">Running the Tests</h2>
<pre><code>ant test</code></pre>
<h1 id="problems">Problems</h1>
<h2 id="problem-1">Problem #1</h2>
<p>There's a bug in our code and a unit test is failing. Run the tests to identify the problem, then fix the code so the unit tests pass and the program works correctly again.</p>
<h2 id="problem-2">Problem #2</h2>
<p>Locations would like to include the day of the week with their reports, so it's clear what day each row applies to. Update the code so that it can handle day names in the <code>.txt</code> report files and include them in the results. Make sure the existing report format (without day of the week) is still supported.</p>
<h2 id="problem-3">Problem #3</h2>
<p>Sort the results in descending order, based on volunteers needed.</p>
<h2 id="problem-4">Problem #4</h2>
<p>Talk us through how you would refactor this program to improve it. If there's time, feel free to implement some of your changes.</p>
